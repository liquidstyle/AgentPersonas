# Image Prompt Guide: Creating Agent Portraits

## Visual Consistency is Key

All agents should share a visual style (same illustration technique, era, or aesthetic) so they feel like a TEAM, not random characters. Consistency + personality = memorability.

## Style Options

Choose one for your entire team:

1. **Portrait Photography**: Headshots in consistent lighting and composition (professional, modern)
2. **Illustrated/Painted**: Hand-drawn or painted style (warm, creative, timeless)
3. **Minimalist Graphic**: Flat shapes, bold colors, geometric (modern, clean, accessible)
4. **Retro/Vintage Card**: Vintage trading card or baseball card aesthetic (fun, distinctive, nostalgia)
5. **Cyberpunk/Tech**: Neon, high-contrast, tech-aesthetic (edgy, future-facing)

**Pick one and stick with it.**

## Anatomy of a Good Image Prompt

A strong prompt has:
- **Subject**: Who is this person? Age, basic appearance
- **Pose/Expression**: Confident? Thoughtful? Action pose?
- **Clothing/Accessories**: Does their dress reflect their role?
- **Background**: Colors, elements that hint at their expertise
- **Lighting**: What mood does the light create?
- **Color Palette**: Signature color for this specialist
- **Format**: Headshot, 3/4 pose, full body?

- Use descriptive but simple clothing (don't over-specify)
- Let the tool handle facial features—just give direction (confident, warm, analytical)
